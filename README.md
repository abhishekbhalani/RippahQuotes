#For Possible Employers
I don't have a working version up as I'm away from my rig at the moment.
The source code here is obviously compilable but it's linked to certain databases that don't exist anymore
which may prove to be a problem.
Site makes use of the MVC model thanks to ASP.Nets built in scaffolding and such, also includes a fully functioning API.
This was just a small project I made for fun and for my mates to use.
