The Source Code for the website formally known as Rippah Quotes and Ripper Quotes

### What is Magnificent Sayings?
Magnificent Sayings is an open community which allows for the free expression of peoples beliefs in an unmoderated environment.
Using the site, users may submit quotes under various topics, create new topics to categorise their quotes under and

The web app was created using ASP.Net MVC.

### For Possible Employers
I don't have a working version up as I'm away from my rig at the moment.
The source code here is obviously compilable but it's linked to certain databases that don't exist anymore
which may prove to be a problem.
Site makes use of the MVC model thanks to ASP.Nets built in scaffolding and such, also includes a fully functioning API.
This was just a small project I made for fun and for my mates to use.
